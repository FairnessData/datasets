# How to contribute to fairness datasets

This repo is for identifying and helping protect datasets about racial discrimination.

For more info, see the [main page](https://fairnessdata.github.io).

## Call to Action and How to Protect Yourself
* Consider creating another GitHub account for this rather than one that can I identify yourself.
* Nominate any datasets as an issue that could meet the restriction above by starting an issue.
* **Do not provide** any information that is clearly proprietary and could identify yourself or others. 
* Please do not as yet 'claim' a dataset or identify yourself.
* Rather, comment on open issues or create a new issue if you don't see an issue for the dataset.
* Again, again: identifying yourself could hurt yourself or others around you or your career.

Thank you for your support!
